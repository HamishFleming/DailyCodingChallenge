# Daily FAANG Interview Questions 

## Overview:
I'll be attempting to do a single interview question every day to further my abilities to work through complex challenges.

Each day's project will be located within their respective folders.
Projects each contain a readme, with the question listed, along with some performance goals. Eacj of the questions allows for 1H of time for solving. I'll be avoiding using google for anything, but anything that I do google will be listed in the notes file, along with any quick notes I take while solving the question.
